## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Most Efficient Approach: **OpenAI TTS API (Recommended)**

**Why This is the Best Option:**
- âœ… **Single Provider**: Both text generation (GPT-4) and voice synthesis (TTS-1-HD)
- âœ… **Cost Effective**: Competitive pricing for both services
- âœ… **High Quality**: Natural-sounding voices with good prosody
- âœ… **Easy Integration**: Single API key and unified SDK
- âœ… **Reliable**: Enterprise-grade uptime and performance

```javascript
// Implementation pseudo-code
const morningBrief = async () => {
  // 1. Fetch latest news from curated sources
  const newsData = await fetchLatestNews();
  
  // 2. Generate briefing text using GPT-4
  const briefingText = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4",
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: MORNING_BRIEF_PROMPT },
      { role: "user", content: `Generate morning brief for ${new Date()}` }
    ]
  });
  
  // 3. Convert to speech using OpenAI TTS
  const audioBuffer = await openai.audio.speech.create({
    model: "tts-1-hd",
    voice: "nova", // Natural, warm female voice
    input: briefingText.choices[0].message.content
  });
  
  // 4. Play audio in React Native
  return audioBuffer;
};
```

### Alternative Options

#### Option 2: ElevenLabs (Premium Quality)
```javascript
// For higher quality voice synthesis
const elevenLabsTTS = async (text) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Accept': 'audio/mpeg',
      'xi-api-key': ELEVENLABS_API_KEY,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      text: text,
      model_id: 'eleven_monolingual_v1',
      voice_settings: {
        stability: 0.5,
        similarity_boost: 0.8
      }
    })
  });
  return response.arrayBuffer();
};
```

#### Option 3: React Native Built-in TTS (Offline)
```javascript
import Tts from 'react-native-tts';

const playBriefing = async (text) => {
  Tts.setDefaultLanguage('en-US');
  Tts.setDefaultRate(0.52);
  Tts.setDefaultPitch(1.0);
  Tts.speak(text);
};
```

## News Source Integration

### Recommended APIs
1. **NewsAPI** - Free tier for development
2. **Associated Press API** - Reliable, professional news
3. **Reuters API** - Global coverage
4. **Custom RSS aggregation** - Multiple sources

### Sample News Fetching
```javascript
const fetchLatestNews = async () => {
  const sources = [
    'bbc-news',
    'reuters',
    'associated-press',
    'techcrunch',
    'bloomberg'
  ];
  
  const newsData = await fetch(`https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources=${sources.join(',')}&apiKey=${NEWS_API_KEY}`);
  return newsData.json();
};
```

## Example Output

### Sample Morning Brief Text
```
Good morning! It's Tuesday, August 12th. Hope you're starting your day well. Let me catch you up on what's happening in the world right now.

The biggest story today is the breakthrough in renewable energy storage announced by researchers at MIT. They've developed a new battery technology that could store solar energy for months, potentially revolutionizing how we think about clean energy infrastructure. This could be a game-changer for addressing climate change at scale.

In other significant news:
- Markets are showing mixed signals as investors react to the latest inflation data, with tech stocks leading the way up while traditional sectors face headwinds
- A major cybersecurity incident affecting several government agencies has been contained, but it's highlighting the ongoing challenges in digital infrastructure protection

NEUTRAL: Standard delivery
URGENT: Slightly faster pace, clearer enunciation
POSITIVE: Warmer tone, slight uplift
CONCERNING: More serious tone, slower pace
BREAKING: Attention-grabbing, clear emphasis
```
